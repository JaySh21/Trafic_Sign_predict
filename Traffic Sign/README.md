# Traffic Sign Recognition Project

## Overview
This project focuses on recognizing German traffic signs using convolutional neural networks. The dataset, preprocessing, augmentation techniques, model architecture, training process, and visualization are all structured and organized in this repository.

## Directory Structure
- `dataset/`: Contains dataset description and any related scripts.
- `preprocessing/`: Scripts for preprocessing the dataset.
- `augmentation/`: Scripts for augmenting the dataset.
- `model/`: Contains model architecture and implementation scripts.
- `training/`: Scripts for training the model.
- `visualization/`: Scripts for visualizing data and results.
- `results/`: Folder to store results and visualizations.

## Setup and Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Follow the instructions in each directory to preprocess, augment, train, and visualize the data and model.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.6+
